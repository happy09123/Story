Chapter 3, The End.

Life was the beginning.
Pain was the Middle.
Death is the End.

Some might have already died, some will soon die, and some will end their life right now in this moment.
Everyone will experience death. But think of it as the last time you will be awake.

Sleeping is just like death. but not permament since you will eventally wake up, but death? it's just slowly squashing the life out of your body until.. there's nothing LEFT.

The circle of life and death continues.
