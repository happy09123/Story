Chapter 2, The Middle.

Life was the beginning.
Pain was the Middle.

Some may lie about the truth, some may tell the truth.
Some will soon experience pain, some may might have been experienced pain, some might be in pain right now. In this very time.

No one knows why, when we experience pain.
Some say it's apart of growing up, some.. will be tired of pain and end their own life, some will just smile through it.

Losing someone you love may be an example of GRIEF, LOSS and PAIN. You may also think of it as a burden, a weight you will be carrying for the rest of your life.

The circle of life and death still continues.
