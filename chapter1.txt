Chapter 1, The Beginning.

Life was the beginning.

One of you were born into earth, some may not.. some may die.
Some may enjoy life, some may hate life, some may be tired of life.
Some questions may be answered easily, some hardly, some of the questions answers may be unknown.

This is the start of the circle of life, and death.
