This was the beginning.

We all were born into earth, the happiest moment your parents had!
We are all blessed by a great man!
Oh! what a joyful to start living!

Everyone can answer your questions! No matter what it is!
Easy, Medium, and Hard!

Your story starts now!

This was the middle.

We are all honest, Since we trust eachother!
Lying is bad! Being truthful will help you all the way to success!
We can understand you! Do not be afraid!
Trust us as your friends!

Even if pain arrives, you can just forget the pain in a matter of seconds!

Your story continues!

This isn't the End.

We will soon vanish in this hopeful world, but the only thing we can do is to be good and honest.
If we are good, we will go to heaven, and not in hell.
Remember, we are someone's great creations, and we have blessings from our family!

Your story isn't ending..?
